## Introduction

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a powerful technique for non-invasively imaging the electrical conductivity distribution within objects. Our submission focuses on developing an innovative algorithm that enhances the quality and accuracy of EIT image reconstructions.

## Algorithm Overview

Our approach to EIT image reconstruction involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the raw EIT measurement data to remove noise and artifacts, ensuring the data is suitable for reconstruction.

2. **Forward Model**: We employ a well-established forward model to simulate the expected measurements based on the given conductivity distribution.

3. **Inverse Problem Solver**: We apply an advanced optimization technique to solve the inverse problem and reconstruct the conductivity distribution from the measured data.

4. **Post-processing**: We further refine the reconstructed image to improve its quality and make it clinically relevant.
